Problem Description

Project Title: Machine Translation from Khasi to English
Overview

Khasi (ka ktien khasi) is an Austroasiatic language that belongs to the Mon-Khmer family of languages. Primarily spoken in the Indian state of Meghalaya, and to a lesser extent in Assam, Khasi is used by about 1 million people. It employs the Latin script for writing. Despite its rich cultural heritage, Khasi is classified as a low-resource language due to the limited availability of digital and linguistic resources necessary for computational tasks.
Some of the challenges  are:
Limited data resources : Since it is a low resource language,the unavailability of large amounts of data is one of the main challenges for training effective machine translation models.
Linguistic Diversity : Khasi, as a language has its own grammatical, syntactic, semantic features which add as another challenge.
Domain Specificity : The text collected may be domain specific such as religious books,folklore limiting the model ability when it comes to new topics and areas.




Thus addressing the above challenges,the project aims to develop an effective and efficient machine translation system for khasi to English,using neural machine translation techniques.
    The goal is to create a robust translation system  that can  improve  communication and information access of the Khasi speaker, thus helping in the  preservation of the Khasi language.
